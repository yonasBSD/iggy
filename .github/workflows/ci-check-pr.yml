#
# CI Check PR Workflow
#
# This workflow validates pull requests to the master branch by detecting changed files
# and running appropriate checks and tests.
#
# Flow:
# 1. pr-file-changes: Detects which file types were modified (mandatory)
# 2. ci-check-common: Validates commit message (mandatory)
# 3. Conditional jobs based on file changes:
#    - For Rust changes: ci-check-rust → ci-test-rust → ci-test-rust-optional & ci-compatibility-rust
#    - For shell changes: ci-check-shell
# 4. finalize-pr: Determines final PR status based on all job results (mandatory)
#
# Dependencies:
# - ci-check-rust depends on pr-file-changes (outputs.trigger-rust)
# - ci-test-rust and ci-compatibility-rust depend on ci-check-rust success
# - ci-check-shell depends on pr-file-changes (outputs.trigger-shell)
# - finalize-pr depends on all other jobs
#
# The workflow fails if any mandatory job fails.
# Workflow can be triggered manually or on pull request events.
