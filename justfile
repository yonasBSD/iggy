# Run Miri (UB detector) on the unsafe-heavy crates that don't pull
# tokio/compio. Mirrors the `miri` task in CI. Pinned to the same nightly
# as `.github/actions/rust/pre-merge/action.yml` so local runs don't drift
# from CI on the next nightly bump — keep these two dates in sync.
# Requires:
#
#   rustup toolchain install nightly-2026-04-21 --component miri
