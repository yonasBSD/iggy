//! Inbound TCP listener for replica-to-replica consensus traffic.
//!
//! # Replica plane = TCP only
//!
//! This module is TCP-only by design, not by omission. Do NOT add WS,
//! QUIC, or HTTP paths here. The VSR chain-hash safety proof
//! (`last_prepare_checksum` in `core/consensus/src/plane_helpers.rs`),
//! the fd-delegation path (`F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC` needs a dupable plaintext
//! fd), the `writev` batching inside the TCP transport, and the single-digit
//! RTT assumptions used by the view-change timer all rest on a FIFO
//! byte stream between a bounded set of replicas on a trusted LAN. A
//! datagram-oriented or gateway-terminated transport violates one or
//! more of those assumptions.
//!
//! Runs only on shard 0. On every accepted `Ping` frame the listener
//! hands the accepted `TcpStream` to an `on_accepted` callback provided
//! by the shard bootstrap, which dup-and-ships the fd to the owning
//! shard via the inter-shard channel
//! (see `shard::coordinator::ShardZeroCoordinator`). This module no
//! longer installs writer / reader tasks itself.
//!
//! Duplicate connections are eliminated by directionality: each replica
//! only dials peers with strictly greater ids and only accepts inbound
//! from peers with strictly lower ids. No race, no tiebreaker.
//!
//! # Trust boundary (regression vs prior MAC)
//!
//! The current listener has NO transport-layer authentication. The
//! `Ping` frame announces the dialing replica's id in plaintext; the
//! bus uses it to key the registry and to enforce the directional rule
//! (only inbound from peers with strictly lower ids), but cannot
//! cryptographically verify the announced id. This is a hard regression
//! versus the previous BLAKE3-keyed MAC over `Ping::reserved_command`
//! bytes paired with a per-peer nonce ring (see TODO at the end of this
//! module preamble). An attacker on the wire who learns the cluster id
//! can register as any peer with a smaller replica id and feed forged
//! consensus traffic until `server-ng` rejects it at the application
//! layer.
//!
//! Until `LOGIN_REPLICA` lands and re-establishes per-peer mutual
//! authentication, operators MUST deploy the replica port on a trusted
//! L2 boundary (cluster-local VPC, dedicated private subnet, encrypted
//! overlay such as `WireGuard`, or an air-gapped management network).
//! Treating "no public exposure of the replica port" as the only gate
//! is the supported configuration; do NOT assume any authentication
//! beyond that boundary.
//!
//! Identity is established post-handshake by the caller (`server-ng`)
//! via the future `LOGIN_REPLICA` command that carries the cluster's
//! shared secret. Until that command succeeds the caller MUST treat the
//! replica as unauthenticated and refuse to honor consensus messages
//! from it.
//!
//! TLS / encryption is NOT provided here: the trusted-boundary
//! deployment requirement above implicitly assumes the operator
//! supplies link-level confidentiality (VPC-level encryption, overlay
//! tunnel, or physical isolation).
//
// TODO(hubcio): the prior BLAKE3-keyed MAC over the `Ping` frame's
// `reserved_command` bytes plus the per-peer nonce ring used to gate
// the registry insert at the transport layer. That gate is gone and
// `LOGIN_REPLICA` is not yet implemented, so the listener currently
// accepts any peer that knows the cluster id and directional rule.
// Restore the transport-layer MAC, or land `LOGIN_REPLICA`, before
// relying on the network boundary alone.
