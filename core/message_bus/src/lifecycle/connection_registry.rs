//! Keyed connection registry shared by the client and replica TCP paths.
//!
//! Each entry owns:
//! - the `BusSender` used by `MessageBus::send_to_*` (a `try_send` into the
//!   per-peer bounded mpsc),
//! - the `JoinHandle` of the writer task (drains the mpsc and pushes batched
//!   `writev` to the wire),
//! - the `JoinHandle` of the reader task (read loop that hands inbound
//!   messages to the consumer's sync callback).
//!
//! Coordination is via the bus-wide [`ShutdownToken`]: triggering it makes
//! reader/writer tasks observe cancellation and exit. `drain` additionally
//! closes each `Sender` so writer tasks see the channel close and finish
//! any in-flight batch before exiting.
