//! Transport abstraction for the `message_bus` wire planes.
//!
//! # Trait family
//!
//! - [`TransportListener`] binds a local address and yields inbound
//!   [`TransportConn`]s on `accept`.
//! - [`TransportConn`] is a single byte-oriented connection. Each
//!   transport owns its own internal task topology behind a single
//!   [`TransportConn::run`] entry point that consumes the connection,
//!   pushes inbound consensus frames into [`ActorContext::in_tx`], and
//!   drains outbound frames from [`ActorContext::rx`] until the bus tears
//!   the connection down.
//!
//! # Invariants the trait surface must preserve
//!
//! - **No-yield on caller-side**: producers call
//!   [`MessageBus::send_to_client`](crate::MessageBus::send_to_client) /
//!   [`send_to_replica`](crate::MessageBus::send_to_replica), which push
//!   onto a bounded `async_channel` and return `Ready` on the first
//!   poll. The single yield point in the wire path lives inside the
//!   transport's `run` body, invoked by the per-peer task.
//! - **Batch ordering**: each transport drains the per-peer
//!   `BusReceiver` in FIFO order, but the dispatch shape differs:
//!     * **TCP (vectored batch)** assembles up to `max_batch` frames
//!       into one `write_vectored_all` call. The kernel may short-write
//!       the iovec set (so `writev` is not atomic), but FIFO order
//!       across the batch is preserved and any short or failed write
//!       tears the connection down rather than retrying on a
//!       half-written batch.
//!     * **TCP-TLS, WS, WSS (drain-and-flush)** drain the same
//!       `max_batch` window into a `Vec<BusMessage>` and then write
//!       each frame through the per-record API (`AsyncWriteExt::write_all`
//!       for TLS, `WebSocketStream::send` for WS / WSS) followed by ONE
//!       trailing `flush()` per batch. This avoids per-frame TCP/TLS
//!       record overhead while staying inside the per-record API
//!       constraints of those transports.
//!     * **QUIC (per-frame)** uses one bidirectional stream per peer
//!       and writes each `BusMessage` with a separate
//!       `SendStream::write_all` call; quinn coalesces at the datagram
//!       layer.
//!
//!   In all four cases, any write failure tears the connection down.
//! - **Zero-copy `Frozen` ownership**: outbound frames are handed to
//!   the kernel without intermediate copies on plaintext TCP. WS / QUIC
//!   / TLS planes pay structural copies in their record layers; see the
//!   per-transport module rustdoc.
//!
//! # Design notes
//!
//! - `'static` bound on [`TransportConn`]: the conn is moved into a
//!   `compio::runtime::spawn`'d task by the installer, which requires
//!   owned data.
//! - fd-delegation (`F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC`) stays TCP-only and lives outside
//!   this trait (see [`crate::fd_transfer`]). Other transports terminate
//!   on shard 0 and forward `Frozen<MESSAGE_ALIGN>` over the inter-shard
//!   crossfire channel via [`crate::ReplicaForwardFn`] / [`crate::ClientForwardFn`].
//!
//! Per-transport impls live in
//! `transports/{tcp,tcp_tls,ws,wss,quic}.rs`.
