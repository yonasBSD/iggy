/// TCP-TLS entry point for client installs.
///
/// Wraps a freshly accepted plaintext [`TcpStream`] (TLS handshake has
/// NOT run yet) plus the shared [`Arc<rustls::ServerConfig>`] in a
/// [`TcpTlsTransportConn`] and delegates to the existing generic
/// [`install_client_conn`]. The rustls handshake then runs inside the
/// transport's `run` body on the per-connection install task, so a slow
/// or malicious peer never blocks the listener accept loop.
///
/// `TCP_NODELAY` is applied to the underlying TCP socket before the
/// handshake starts, matching [`super::tcp::install_client_tcp`]'s
/// plaintext behaviour. Linux does not propagate it from the listener
/// to accepted sockets, so toggling here is required. `SO_KEEPALIVE`
/// is intentionally NOT set; see `socket_opts`.
///
/// TCP-TLS is shard-0 terminal: the rustls connection state machine
/// is non-serialisable and tied to the local task; pre-handshake the
/// fd is plain TCP and could in principle be dup'd to another shard,
/// but the receiving shard would then have to re-handshake against
/// shard-0-resident key material — losing the point of the cross-shard
/// handover.
