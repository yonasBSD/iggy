/// QUIC entry point for client installs.
///
/// Takes the [`AcceptedQuicConn`] produced by shard 0's QUIC listener
/// (already through the QUIC handshake AND the first bidirectional
/// `accept_bi` so the install path never re-handshakes), unwraps it
/// internally, wraps the parts in a [`QuicTransportConn`], and
/// delegates to the existing generic [`install_client_conn`].
///
/// Accepting [`AcceptedQuicConn`] (rather than the raw `compio_quic`
/// types it carries) keeps `compio_quic`'s concrete types out of the
/// bus's public `SemVer` surface: a future `compio_quic` bump that
/// renames or restructures `Connection` / `SendStream` / `RecvStream`
/// does not change this signature.
///
/// No socket-options analog runs here: QUIC keepalive lives in
/// [`compio_quic::TransportConfig::keep_alive_interval`] set at endpoint
/// construction time. The connection is encrypted end-to-end and there
/// is no plaintext fd to dup, which is why this never crosses an
/// inter-shard channel: shard 0 owns the QUIC `Endpoint`, terminates
/// every connection locally, and uses the existing
/// `ForwardClientSend` / `Consensus` shard-frame variants for outbound
/// + inbound traffic respectively.
