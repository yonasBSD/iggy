# InfluxDB Sink Connector — Direct Runtime Dependencies

This file lists every direct (non-dev) dependency declared in
`core/connectors/sinks/influxdb_sink/Cargo.toml`, together with
its workspace-pinned version, license, and the specific role it plays
in this connector. Transitive dependencies are not listed here; refer
to `cargo tree -p iggy_connector_influxdb_sink` for the full graph.

> **No new dependencies were added in this PR (`feat/influxdb_v2_v3_connector`).**
> All changes are within existing dependencies. The `base64::Engine::encode_string`
> API (already in `base64 ^0.22.1`) replaced `encode()` to write directly into
> the output buffer without an intermediate `String` allocation (see review
> comment `sink/lib.rs:562`).

## Runtime dependencies

| Crate | Version (workspace) | License | Role in this connector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `async-trait` | `^0.1.89` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Proc-macro that enables `async fn` in trait definitions; required by the `Sink` trait impl in `lib.rs`. |
| `base64` | `^0.22.1` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Encodes raw message payloads as base64 when `payload_format = "base64"` is configured. Uses `Engine::encode_string` to write directly into the line-protocol output buffer with no intermediate allocation. |
| `bytes` | `^1.11.1` | MIT | Zero-copy `Bytes::from(body.into_bytes())` converts the line-protocol string body into the request body sent to InfluxDB's write endpoint without an extra copy. |
| `iggy_common` | `^0.10.1-edge.1` | Apache-2.0 | Shared Iggy types: `serde_secret` for safe token serialisation in config structs. |
| `iggy_connector_sdk` | `^0.3.1-edge.1` | Apache-2.0 | Core connector abstractions: `Sink` trait, `ConsumedMessage`, `MessagesMetadata`, `TopicMetadata`, `Error`, retry/circuit-breaker utilities, and the `sink_connector!` registration macro. |
| `reqwest` | `^0.13.3` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Async HTTP client used to POST line-protocol batches to `/api/v2/write` (V2) and `/api/v3/write_lp` (V3). |
| `reqwest-middleware` | `^0.5.1` | MIT | Middleware wrapper around `reqwest::Client` that attaches the retry and tracing layers built by `iggy_connector_sdk::retry::build_retry_client`. |
| `secrecy` | `^0.10` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | `SecretString` / `SecretBox` wrappers that prevent accidental logging of API tokens in config structs and the `auth_header` field. |
| `serde` | `^1.0.228` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Derive macros for config struct de/serialisation (`V2SinkConfig`, `V3SinkConfig`). |
| `serde_json` | `^1.0.149` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Serialises JSON message payloads to compact strings for the `payload_json` field; used in the custom `InfluxDbSinkConfig` deserialiser that handles the `version` discriminator. |
| `tokio` | `^1.52.3` | MIT | Async runtime; `SystemTime::now()` (via `std::time`) provides the wall-clock fallback for messages with `timestamp == 0`. Tokio itself is an indirect requirement through the connector SDK. |
| `tracing` | `^0.1.44` | MIT | Structured logging macros (`info!`, `warn!`, `error!`, `debug!`) used throughout the consume loop, circuit-breaker paths, and config-validation guards. |

## Dev-only dependencies

| Crate | Version | License | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `axum` | `^0.8.9` | MIT | Minimal HTTP server used in `#[tokio::test]` http_tests to mock the InfluxDB V2 (`/api/v2/write`) and V3 (`/api/v3/write_lp`) write endpoints and the shared `/health` probe endpoint. |
| `toml` | `^1.1.2` | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Deserialises TOML config snippets in unit tests that validate backward-compatible config loading. |

## Dependency change log

| Version | Change | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.4.1-edge.1 | No Cargo.toml changes | `base64 ^0.22.1` (already a dependency) gained additional usage: `Engine::encode_string` now writes base64 directly into the line-protocol string buffer, eliminating the intermediate `String` allocation that the previous `encode()` call produced. |
