# InfluxDB Source Connector

A source connector that polls InfluxDB and produces messages into Iggy streams. Supports both InfluxDB V2 (OSS 2.x / Cloud 2.x, Flux queries) and InfluxDB V3 (Core / Enterprise, SQL queries).

## V2 vs V3 Differences

| Aspect | InfluxDB V2 | InfluxDB V3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data organisation | `org` (query param) | `db` |
| Query endpoint | `POST /api/v2/query` | `POST /api/v3/query_sql` |
| Query language | Flux | SQL |
| Response format | Annotated CSV | JSONL (one JSON object per line) |
| Auth header | `Authorization: Token {t}` | `Authorization: Bearer {t}` |
| Cursor semantics | `>= $cursor` (inclusive) | `> '$cursor'` (exclusive) |
| Default cursor field | `_time` | `time` |
| Config `version` key | `"v2"` (or omit — default) | `"v3"` |
| Payload value types | All fields as strings (CSV has no types); `parse_scalar` coerces to bool/int/float where possible | Native JSON types: numbers, booleans, and nulls preserved as-is from SQL |

> **Breaking schema note for consumers migrating V2 → V3**: a field that arrives as the string `"42"` under V2 will arrive as the integer `42` under V3. Update consumer deserialization accordingly.

## Cursor-Based Polling

Both versions use an RFC 3339 timestamp cursor stored in persistent connector state. On each poll the cursor is substituted into the query template via the `$cursor` and `$limit` placeholders; after a successful batch the cursor advances to the highest timestamp seen.

### V2 Cursor Semantics

V2 Flux queries use `>= $cursor` (inclusive). Rows at the cursor timestamp are re-delivered by the first query after a cursor advance and must be skipped. The connector tracks `cursor_row_count` in persisted state and skips exactly that many leading rows to prevent duplicate delivery.

The Flux query **must** sort by the cursor field when using `>=` semantics. The connector enforces this at startup and returns an error if `>=` is present without a `|> sort(columns: ["_time"])` call.

### V3 Cursor Semantics

V3 SQL uses strict `WHERE time > '$cursor'` — no rows are re-delivered across batch boundaries. The query **must** include `OFFSET $offset` when `stuck_batch_cap_factor > 0` (the default). The connector validates this at startup.

#### Stuck-Timestamp Handling (V3)

InfluxDB 3's DataFusion engine does not guarantee stable row ordering for rows that share the same timestamp. Two full-batch scenarios require special handling:

**All rows share the same timestamp** — the cursor cannot advance. The connector:

1. Doubles `effective_batch_size` on each stuck poll, up to `stuck_batch_cap_factor × batch_size`.
2. Uses `OFFSET $offset` to page through the tied rows without re-delivering earlier ones.
3. Trips the circuit breaker when the cap is reached and resets `effective_batch_size` to `batch_size` after the cool-down so the connector recovers cleanly.

**Mixed timestamps, full batch** — the batch is full and rows span more than one timestamp. Advancing the cursor to the highest timestamp seen would silently discard rows at that timestamp that did not fit in the batch. The connector:

1. Emits only rows whose timestamp is strictly less than the batch maximum (`safe_message_count` rows).
2. Advances the cursor to the second-highest distinct timestamp seen (`penultimate_cursor`) so the next poll re-fetches all rows at the maximum timestamp cleanly via `WHERE time > penultimate_cursor`.
3. Resets `effective_batch_size` to `batch_size` (no inflation needed — cursor advanced).

## Configuration

### V2 — InfluxDB OSS 2.x / Cloud

```toml
version  = "v2"          # optional — omitting defaults to v2
url      = "http://localhost:8086"
org      = "my-org"
token    = "my-token"
query    = '''
  from(bucket: "telemetry")
    |> range(start: time(v: "$cursor"))
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "cpu")
    |> sort(columns: ["_time"])
    |> limit(n: $limit)
'''

# Optional
poll_interval   = "5s"        # how often to issue queries (default: "5s")
batch_size      = 500         # max rows per query (default: 500)
cursor_field    = "_time"     # column used as the cursor (default: "_time")
initial_offset  = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"  # starting cursor on first run
payload_column  = ""          # extract a single column as payload (default: whole row as JSON)
payload_format  = "json"      # json | text | raw (default: "json")
include_metadata = true       # include all row columns in the payload (default: true)
verbose_logging  = false
```

### V3 — InfluxDB 3.x Core / Enterprise

```toml
version = "v3"
url     = "http://localhost:8181"
db      = "my-db"
token   = "my-token"
query   = '''
  SELECT * FROM cpu
  WHERE time > '$cursor'
  ORDER BY time
  LIMIT $limit OFFSET $offset
'''

# Optional
poll_interval        = "5s"
batch_size           = 500
cursor_field         = "time"    # default cursor column for V3 (default: "time")
initial_offset       = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
payload_column       = ""
payload_format       = "json"
include_metadata     = true
stuck_batch_cap_factor = 10      # max effective_batch = 10 × batch_size (default: 10, max: 100)
                                 # set to 0 to disable stuck-batch detection entirely;
                                 # $offset is not required in the query when cap = 0
verbose_logging      = false
```

### Resilience Fields (both versions)

```toml
timeout                   = "10s"   # per-request timeout
max_retries               = 3       # retries per query on transient errors (429/5xx)
retry_delay               = "1s"    # initial backoff
retry_max_delay           = "5s"    # backoff cap
max_open_retries          = 10      # retries during open() health check
open_retry_max_delay      = "60s"   # backoff cap for open() retries
circuit_breaker_threshold = 5       # consecutive failures before circuit trips
circuit_breaker_cool_down = "30s"   # cool-down before half-open probe
```

## Query Template Placeholders

| Placeholder | Substituted with |
| --- | --- |
| `$cursor` | Current cursor value (RFC 3339 timestamp) |
| `$limit` | Current effective batch size |
| `$offset` | Row offset within the current cursor group (V3 only; required when `stuck_batch_cap_factor > 0`) |

## Payload Formats

- **`json`** (default): Behaviour differs by version.
  - **V3**: Each row is a flat JSON object. `include_metadata = false` excludes the cursor column (`time`); all other columns are present. `include_metadata = true` (the default) includes all columns.
  - **V2**: Each row is wrapped in an envelope: `{"measurement":"..","field":"..","timestamp":"..","value":..,"row":{..}}`. The `row` object always includes `_time` and `_value`. `include_metadata = false` additionally excludes `_measurement` and `_field` from `row`; `include_metadata = true` includes them.
- **`text`**: The value of `payload_column` is written as a UTF-8 string. Requires `payload_column` to be set.
- **`raw`**: The value of `payload_column` is base64-decoded and written as raw bytes. Requires `payload_column` to be set.

[[sources]]
key     = "influxdb-source"
enabled = true
path    = "target/release/libiggy_connector_influxdb_source"

[[sources.streams]]
stream       = "metrics"

linger_time  = "10ms"

[sources.plugin_config]

url            = "http://localhost:8181"
db             = "telemetry"
token          = "my-secret-token"
query          = """
  SELECT * FROM cpu
  WHERE time > '$cursor'
  ORDER BY time
  LIMIT $limit OFFSET $offset
"""
poll_interval          = "10s"
batch_size             = 1000
initial_offset         = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
stuck_batch_cap_factor = 10
circuit_breaker_threshold = 3
circuit_breaker_cool_down = "15s"
```

## Architecture Notes

The source uses a layered design with version-specific modules:

- **`v2` module**: Flux query construction, annotated-CSV response parsing, skip-N deduplication for `>=` cursor semantics.
- **`v3` module**: SQL query construction, JSONL response parsing, stuck-batch detection and cap inflation.
- **`common` module**: Shared cursor state management, payload format handling, retry/circuit-breaker logic, and the `RowContext` passed into both `process_rows` functions.

Persisted state (via the connector runtime's state store) holds the last cursor value and, for V2, the `cursor_row_count` needed to skip duplicate rows. State is versioned so V2 and V3 states are never confused on a connector restart.

### V2 vs V3 API Comparison

| Concern | InfluxDB V2 | InfluxDB V3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Write body format | Line Protocol | Line Protocol |
| Query body format | JSON (Flux query payload) | JSON (SQL query payload) |
| Health check | `GET /health` | `GET /health` |
| Retry triggers | 429 / 5xx | 429 / 5xx |
| Cursor field default | `_time` | `time` |
| Timestamp format | RFC 3339 with TZ | RFC 3339 (TZ appended by connector if absent) |
| Sort guarantee | Flux <code>\|> sort(...)</code> explicit | DataFusion — no stable order for tied timestamps |
