//! On-disk schema for the `server-ng` binary.
//!
//! Mirrors the legacy server-config section surface verbatim
//! (operator-facing schema is unchanged) and adds a `message_bus` section
//! for inter-shard / inter-replica bus tunables previously hardcoded in
//! the `core/message_bus` runtime crate.
//!
//! Scaffolding-only at the time of introduction: the type is defined and
//! loadable but no binary calls [`server_ng::ServerNgConfig::load`]; the
//! wiring PR for `core/server-ng`'s bootstrap and the message_bus crate's
//! runtime type is a separate change.
