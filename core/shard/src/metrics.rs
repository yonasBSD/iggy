//! Per-shard frame-drop accounting.
//!
//! [`ShardMetrics`] holds `frame_drops_total{variant, reason}`,
//! bumped whenever an inter-shard `try_send` is rejected (`Full` /
//! `Disconnected`) or its target shard id is out of range
//! (`Unroutable`):
//! - [`crate::coordinator::ShardZeroCoordinator`] - fd-transfer delegation.
//! - the cross-shard forward closures built in [`crate::builder`].
//! - `IggyShard::try_send_to_target` - consensus frames.
//!
//! The counter uses atomic interior mutability, safe to bump from `!Send`
//! compio reactor contexts. Each shard owns its own instance. It is not
//! yet exposed through a scrape endpoint; every drop site also logs via
//! `tracing`, so the counter is a structured complement to those logs
//! until a per-shard exporter lands.
//!
//! TODO(hubcio): register `frame_drops_total` with a per-shard prometheus
//! exporter so the counter is scrape-able; until then the `tracing`
//! drop-site logs are the only alertable signal.
